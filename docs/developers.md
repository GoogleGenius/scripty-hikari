## **Installation**

Self-hosting an instance of Scripty is unrecommended. Please [invite our hosted version](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=883496337616822302&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) instead.

!!! note
    There is an exception to this statement explained below.

## **Contributing**

Please check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scriptydev/prescripty) for guidelines.

While we do not support self-hosting, we do encourage contributions so that we can improve Scripty. Thus, setting up the bot simply involves modiying the [`config.toml`](https://github.com/scriptydev/prescripty/blob/c31ee1d63d1475bbd8cd764e02c31ca08934755b/config.toml) file with the respective values, and then adding an `_` prefix to the file name. After installing the Python requirements, run `python -m scripty` in the root directory in order to start the bot.
